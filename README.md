This is a tool designed to assist sprite animators. It takes either horizontal or vertical spritesheet and displays it as an animation, as well as providing an option to export to a GIF. This was coded in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#readme"). It also uses [Gif.js](http://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js) for GIF export, [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for CSS, and icons from [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/).
